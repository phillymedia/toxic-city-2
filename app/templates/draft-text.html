<p>Her Kensington neighborhood is full of charm. Swank cafes with rustic wood and vintage lighting. Stoops and decks with skyline views. A network of young parents who bond at parks while their children play.</p>
<p>Jana Curtis, a mother of three, finds excitement in this urban renaissance.</p>
<p>But with it comes a sad reality.</p>
<p>Her daughter was poisoned by lead. The culprit wasn&rsquo;t paint. Or tap water. But soil &ndash; in her own back yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yard was poisoning my daughter,&rdquo; Curtis said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so horrifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curtis and her family live in the heart of what was once Philadelphia&rsquo;s industrial hub. For more than 150 years, the &ldquo;river ward&rdquo; neighborhoods of Fishtown, Kensington and Port Richmond, which snake along the Delaware, were blanketed
    with hulking factories and lead smelters. It was a time when manufacturers used lead in everything from paints to plastics. Lunch-pail laborers walked to work from tightly packed rowhomes as lead dust spewed from smokestacks, coating sidewalks, stoops
    and yards.</p>


<p>Once in the soil, the heavy metal stays indefinitely. Even minuscule amounts can permanently lower a child&rsquo;s IQ and cause behavioral problems.</p>
<p>At one time, Philadelphia had 38 lead smelters &ndash; more than any other city in America. Fourteen alone operated in the river wards.</p>
<p>The lead plants are long gone, either razed or shuttered. But their toxic legacy remains.</p>
<p>Today a development boom is disturbing lead that has sat dormant for decades. Construction crews &ndash; unchecked by government &ndash;churn up poisonous soil that can spread toxic dust across these gentrifying neighborhoods. This renaissance puts a
    new generation of children at risk.</p>
<p>In the area&rsquo;s most sweeping environmental investigation to date, reporters tested soil in 114 locations in the river wards &ndash; parks, playgrounds, yards. Nearly three out of four had hazardous levels of lead contamination &ndash; a problem of
    previously unknown severity.</p>
<p>In addition, reporters discovered high levels of lead dust on rowhome stoops and sidewalks near construction sites. In tests taken from a popular neighborhood playground &ndash; both before and after digging began at a vacant lot across the street &ndash;
    a once-safe play area was shown to contain lead dust.</p>
<p>Developers are not required to test soil for lead as a routine precaution before disturbing land.&nbsp; Further, no single governmental agency is responsible for making certain your soil is safe.</p>
<p>Federal, state and city officials quibble over who, if anyone, should regulate development within a former industrial area. State and federal officials say they only oversee development and cleanup within the boundaries of known contaminated sites. &nbsp;City
    officials say they don&rsquo;t regulate soil.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s Department of Public Health is supposed to enforce a regulation that requires construction crews to contain noxious dust. Reporters spent five months in these neighborhoods, testing soil, interviewing residents and keeping tabs on at
    least two dozen ongoing construction sites. Not once did they see workers take dust-control measures, even something as simple as spraying water to hold down dust.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city enforces dust regulations &ldquo;to the extent that we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farley pointed out that lead paint &ndash; not soil &ndash; is the primary source of childhood lead poisoning. He said city health data does not show that children who reside near former lead smelters have higher blood lead levels when compared with those
    who live in old homes in poorer neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Farley said while parents should try and prevent their children from playing in dirt in these neighborhoods, he doesn&rsquo;t consider soil a major risk. &ldquo;Risk from soil and dust is &ndash; it&rsquo;s certainly a theoretical risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Experts such as Mary Jean Brown, former chief of lead-poisoning prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, strongly disagree. Brown spearheaded a 2014 CDC study here of contaminated soil in the river wards that found &nbsp;xxx</p>
<p>There are dangerous levels of lead in the soil in these neighborhoods, so let&rsquo;s do <em>something, </em>she said.</p>
<p>The wave of new construction only adds to the peril, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they&rsquo;re digging it up and it&rsquo;s fine enough to be inhaled, then it&rsquo;s a big issue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ignore this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Break</em></strong></p>
<p>Jenni Drozdek and Dan Morgan knew all about the neighborhood&rsquo;s toxic legacy when they moved into their home on Cumberland Street in Kensington.</p>
<p>They even had their soil tested before planting a garden in 2011. The result came back at 662 parts per million (ppm), considerably higher than the federal threshold. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers hazardous any lead concentration
    above 400 ppm in soil where children play.</p>
<p>The couple installed raised beds filled with new topsoil so they could plant kale, tomatoes, herbs, beets and carrots. They also spread a thick, protective layer of mulch over the rest of the yard.</p>
<p>When their daughter, Mina, was born three years later, they thought she would be safe.</p>


<p>Then the construction fever hit.</p>
<p>All around them, demolition crews worked at a frenzied pace. The buzz of saws and the rhythmic bleep of excavators backing up could be heard on almost every block. In their 19125 zip code, the number of demolitions doubled between 2015 and 2016. Construction
    projects that stirred up soil quadrupled over six years.</p>
<p>The mammoth reconstruction of I-95 at the Girard Avenue Interchange also added to the dust bowl.</p>
<p>The grit made residents&rsquo; eyes water. And there were days when Drozdek found her gray Nissan blanketed in dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to clean it off because I couldn&rsquo;t see out the windows,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Last August, the city&rsquo;s Department of Public Health adopted more stringent dust control regulations. But some 30 Fishtown and Kensington residents interviewed in the past few months said they never witnessed a construction project with dust controls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no effort to contain it whatsoever,&rdquo; Drozdek said.</p>
<p>The couple often takes Mina to one of the busiest parks in Fishtown, Shissler Recreation Center on Blair Street. It was once the site of a major railroad hub and train yard.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a reporter took a dust-wipe sample from the playground and found no detectable levels of lead.</p>
<p>About three months later, in early May, a reporter took another sample from the same spot. At the time, construction workers were using heavy equipment to dig into vacant land across the street. Dust and dirt were swirling around as children were busy
    at play.</p>
<p>This sample shot up to 127.4 micrograms of lead in dust per square foot. While there is no federal hazard level for outdoor surfaces, the limit for entryways and indoor floors is 10 and 40 for porches. There is no way to know for sure whether the lead
    came from the construction site across the street.</p>
<p>Exposure to contaminated soil and demolition debris containing lead paint can significantly increase blood lead levels in children, studies show.</p>
<p>A child who inhales lead dust faces more danger than one who swallows dirt because dust has a more direct path to the brain, experts say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingestion is bad,&rdquo; said Richard Pepino, an environmental toxicology expert at the University of Pennsylvania. &ldquo;Inhalation is worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple dust-control measures can prevent people from being harmed, but the health department only has four air management inspectors and two supervisors to oversee a city that last year alone had 3,000 demolition and construction jobs.</p>
<p>When Drozdek and Morgan took Mina to her routine one-year checkup, her bloodwork came back with a poisonous level of lead: 9 micrograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>The CDC says public health and pediatricians should intervene when children have a blood lead level of 5. At that level, children lose six IQ points on average. Even with lower lead levels, children exhibit increased impulsivity, aggression and hyperactivity,
    and have diminished academic abilities, research shows. In adults, low-level exposure can cause memory loss and depression, and harm the heart, kidneys, brain and reproductive functions.</p>
<p>For now, Philadelphia&rsquo;s health department only investigates when a child hits a level 10. Drozdek&rsquo;s daughter is among some 2,000 city children every year who spike a blood lead level between 5 and 10 and whose families are left to fend for
    themselves.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was terrified because you hear how lead poisoning and any kind of lead levels can be dangerous,&rdquo; Drozdek said.</p>
<p>Drozdek bought kits to detect lead on painted surfaces and tested all over her house. That wasn&rsquo;t it. The couple had their water tested. They ruled that out, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was definitely coming from the outside,&rdquo; Morgan concluded. But where exactly?</p>
<p>Drozdek and Morgan invited reporters to retest their yard. At the time, a giant excavator clawed into a large vacant lot on Letterly Street directly behind their house. Digging had gone on for days, creating a hole roughly the size of an Olympic swimming
    pool.
</p>
<p>Around the corner at Amber and Cumberland streets, a work crew heaped dirt and rubble into 8-feet-high piles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are mounds of it and children climb on it and play on it,&rdquo; Drozdek said. &ldquo;Then of course when it&rsquo;s windy, the top layer gets blown all over the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two soil samples from their backyard tested high for lead &ndash; 635 and 726.</p>
<p>Reporters also swipe tested for lead dust on their front steps. It came back at 1,760 micrograms, 44 times higher than the residential limit.</p>
<p>When told the result, Drozdek was speechless, realizing that Mina had spent hours on the stoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would grab the steps and pivot herself to the next one,&rdquo; Drozdek said. &ldquo;Of course, she&rsquo;s a little kid so she&rsquo;s putting hands in her mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mina&rsquo;s blood lead level is lower now. Every day, the couple gives her iron drops to prevent lead from binding to her bones. They clean religiously, even wiping down stroller wheels.</p>
<p>Still, as the construction boom continues, they wonder if it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
<p><strong><em>Break</em></strong></p>


<p>It&rsquo;s almost become routine. Jana Curtis finds herself pushing her baby stroller through her Kensington neighborhood, her three kids in tow, when suddenly she freezes. The minute she sees construction machinery digging up dirt, sending plumes of
    potentially hazardous dust into the air, Curtis abruptly zooms across the street to avoid any danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always on my mind,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She sweeps the front steps of her York Street home regularly. There are no shoes allowed in the house, so sneakers and sandals are neatly lined up at the front door. She vacuums twice a day and mops once.</p>
<p>She misses her two dogs who passed away, but won&rsquo;t adopt another. A dog would track toxic dirt into the house. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth it with them going outside and coming back in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their paws. I can&rsquo;t
    take <em>their</em> shoes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If one of her kids drops a piece of food on the ground, there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;five-second rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scream, &lsquo;No! You can&rsquo;t touch it!&rsquo; We look like crazy people,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She has good reason to be hypervigilant. Three years ago, the CDC tested her tap water and backyard soil as part of a lead study in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>She was stunned by the results. Her house and water were safe. But her yard tested at 1,100 ppm &ndash; nearly three times the federal limit.</p>
<p>Curtis rushed her daughter, Nolyn, 11 months old at the time, to her pediatrician for a blood test. She had a lead level of 14 micrograms per deciliter, almost three times higher than the amount that the CDC considers troubling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was heartbreaking,&rdquo; Curtis said.</p>
<p>At 18 months, Nolyn only spoke two words. Curtis&rsquo; oldest child at the same age had a vocabulary of 70.</p>
<p>Curtis, and her husband, William Pace, a physician who specializes in infectious diseases, enrolled Nolyn in speech therapy and played educational games with her. Now three, Nolyn took big leaps in speech but &ldquo;still has pretty significant behavioral
    challenges,&rdquo; Curtis said.</p>
<p>Her daughter struggles to make simple decisions, which can trigger temper tantrums.</p>
<p>So Curtis eliminates choices. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one sippy cup for her because every morning there was this big battle. She can&rsquo;t even make a choice between two so we only have one kind. There&rsquo;s no choice. There&rsquo;s only one pair
    of shoes. One coat. One cup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At times, guilt still plagues her. &ldquo;Maybe if I&rsquo;d cleaned more, she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten this. Maybe if I had mopped every day, she&rsquo;d be fine,&rdquo; she said, her voice cracking.</p>
<p>Still, there&rsquo;s only so much that brooms and sanitizers can do, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to clean our way out of this problem,&rdquo; Curtis said. &ldquo;I can clean up enough to protect, Graham, my littlest. But you can&rsquo;t clean your way out of this toxic-ness that&rsquo;s coming from all these different
    places. There&rsquo;s got to be a bigger solution than what I can do in my four walls. It just can&rsquo;t be about mopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><em>Break</em></strong></p>
<p>Longtime residents like Gregory Antczak thought they had found something of a solution to their neighborhood&rsquo;s toxic legacy more than a generation ago. Now they know differently.</p>
<p>Antczak grew up in the shadow of the area&rsquo;s most notorious lead factory, an 8-acre complex of buildings and 20 smokestacks sprawled along both sides of Aramingo Avenue.&nbsp; Over the decades, residents knew the behemoth by different names. John
    T. Lewis Brothers. Dutch Boy Paint. National Lead. And finally, Anzon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always did the same thing,&rdquo; said Antczak, 68, of the companies. &ldquo;They processed millions and millions of pounds of lead in the middle of a highly-populated residential neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a boy, he had to take part in routine family evacuations. &ldquo;A siren would go off inside the factory. It was like an air-raid siren, shrill and high,&rdquo; he said. The sound signaled a fire, chemical spill or some other peril.</p>
<p>His dad would utter the same four words: &ldquo;Get in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antczak and his older brother would hop into the family&rsquo;s two-tone 1950 Ford &mdash; white roof, salmon-colored body &ndash; as black smoke and a noxious smell filled the air. His dad drove eight miles north to Antczak&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same thing all the time,&rdquo; Antczak said. &ldquo;We get there, the coffee pot would go on the stove, the cake would come out of the refrigerator and then we&rsquo;d wait it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family had a puppy, a black mutt named Eliza Jane. At only a year old, the dog has a distended stomach and couldn&rsquo;t stop vomiting. Their beloved pet died from what the vet called &ldquo;lead belly,&rdquo; Antczak said.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Antczak, who worked as a mailman, got married and bought a house near his family on Almond Street, about a block and a half from the plant. Several years later, a plant fire blasted out so much lead dust that Anzon evacuated the surrounding
    blocks. It took Anzon three days to vacuum streets and sidewalks, and decontaminate homes, inside and out.</p>
<p>By then, Antczak and other nearby residents had had enough. They sued Anzon in 198x for contaminating their homes and imperiling their children. Years later, they settled with the company. Most families received anywhere from a few thousand dollars up
    to, in one case, $16,000. Many families used some of the money to pave over their back yards with concrete to encapsulate the toxic soil.</p>
<p>Anzon began demolishing the plant in the 1999, leaving behind a vast pile of dirt. The EPA said the site was too toxic for new homes. So under a special program designed to develop contaminated land for commercial use, the state Department of Environmental
    Protection (DEP) oversaw a clean-up, completed in 2003.</p>
<p>The former brownfield is now an asphalt-covered retail hub with an Applebee&rsquo;s, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, Rite Aid, AutoZone and Wawa, thanks to Port Richmond Development, a private company. Rather than carting off the toxic mound, the developer was
    allowed to cap it with a foot or more of clean fill dirt and plant grass.&nbsp; Residents have dubbed the mound&nbsp; &ldquo;Mt. Wawa.&rdquo; Many cringe when they see children playing on it.</p>
<p>As part of an agreement with the DEP, the developer has to have an environmental company inspect the hill and surrounding asphalt every year. The task involves little more than looking at it.</p>
<p>An inspection log for the site from 2004 to 2012 shows that an inspector wrote the same two sentences for the nine consecutive visits: &ldquo;All asphalt perfect condition. All grass and landscaping perfectly in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state does not require the developer to test for lead in the fill dirt capping the mound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents have had their doubts. Five years ago, some of them urged the EPA to determine whether Mt. Wawa was safe.&nbsp; The developer&rsquo;s environmental firm gave an answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to report, as expected, that the cap is being appropriately maintained, and remains protective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reporters recently tested a patch of bare soil at the apron of Mt. Wawa. Its lead level came back at 2,904 ppm, about six times the allowable limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were told it was safe, that it was all encapsulated,&rdquo; said Sandy Salzman, former executive director of the New Kensington Community Development Corporation. This news brought fresh worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the summer time, the kids play there and slide down the hill,&rdquo; Saltzman said.</p>
<p>RESPONSE FROM DEVELOPER HERE</p>
<p>Just across the street is Cione Playground, which decades ago had been saturated with Anzon&rsquo;s lead. In a one-time arrangement, the city received $500,000 from the company in 199<strong>x</strong> to abate the lead and, under EPA guidance, make the
    playground safe for the public.</p>
<p>Reporters recently tested soil at Cione&rsquo;s ballfields, and it came back low. But soil tested in four locations near the community swimming pool returned unsafe levels, between 613 and 955 ppm.</p>
<p>Told of the test results, city spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said the city was not responsible for regulating soil. &ldquo;If we become aware of a toxic soil situation, we notify EPA and /or DEP,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p><strong><em>Break</em></strong></p>
<p>Brown, the former CDC lead expert who now teaches at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, put it in blunt terms: &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s problem is nobody&rsquo;s problem,&rdquo; she told a group of peers at an EPA workshop last year in Philadelphia
    on lead hazards in urban soil.</p>
<p>Most everyone in the room agreed that contaminated soil is an urgent problem. But not everyone could agree on a solution &ndash; or which agency should take charge.</p>
<p>Brown has grown weary of the hand-wringing and often fruitless quests to find the responsible culprit from years past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it get in the soil? That train has already left the station,&rdquo; Brown said in a recent interview. &ldquo;We know it&rsquo;s there. We know how to fix it. Now let&rsquo;s fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Government should not use little kids as walking test tubes, tackling lead hotspots only after little kids suffer neurological damage, she said. The best way to protect them is to remove all the toxic soil, she said.</p>
<p>It sounds so simple. But is it?</p>
<p>Reporters shared their test results with the state DEP, including one for a Fishtown back yard that came back at 9,883 ppm. Patrick McDonnell, the agency&rsquo;s secretary, replied:&nbsp;&ldquo;Anytime we see sample results like this, it&rsquo;s definitely
    cause for concern,&rdquo; McDonnell said last week.</p>
<p>The state has laws to hold polluters accountable. But as it stands now, the DEP has no regulatory power to remedy what McDonnell calls widespread &ldquo;historic pollution or contamination.&rdquo; McDonnell, who confirmed by the Senate last month, said
    he is still trying to determine whether the state has any authority to require developers to test soil for lead before disturbing land adjacent to known brownfield parcels.</p>
<p>As for the 82 of 114 properties that tested above 400 ppm for lead, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d need to look at specific sites and where our regulatory authorities are. Can we figure out the source of the contamination? Are there still viable responsible parties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We absolutely want to engage and understand the extent of&rdquo; the problem, McDonnell said.</p>
<p>So does Jack Kelly, an EPA official based here. Kelly has been waving his arms at higher ups for years about the lead problems in Fishtown, Kensington and Port Richmond. years.&nbsp; In a perfect world, residents all over the area would allow him to test
    their soil and he could map the boundaries of the contamination and make a case to his bosses that back yards in this area should qualify for federal clean-up money.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Kelly has convinced the EPA to take the usual step of contracting with a phlebotomist to test the blood lead levels in children, ages 6 and under, who live in three river ward zip codes &ndash; 19125, 19134 and 19137 &ndash; as a public
    service.</p>
<p>The EPA is still working out the details but hopes to begin testing this summer. During a community meeting earlier this year, residents like Jana Curtis, whose child was poisoned by soil, broached the elephant in the room: &ldquo;Is there any danger
    of this money disappearing, given the current political climate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kelly struggled to answer the question, knowing that the Trump Administration has proposed slashing EPA&rsquo;s budget by nearly one third, more than any other agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is, not compared to a lot of work we do, a big-ticket item,&rdquo; Kelly told Curtis. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to lose the money for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, is tired of inertia. He and fellow clinicians and scientists recently formed Project TENDR (Targeting Environmental Neurodevelopment Risks). Last month, the group, in the medical
    journal JAMA Pediatrics, called for &ldquo;remediation of lead-contaminated soils from former industrial sites in residential areas&rdquo; and for &ldquo;federal, state and local governments to provide a dedicated funding steam to identify and eliminate
    sources of lead exposure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bellinger said the findings by reporters that high levels of lead lurk in the soil in these neighborhoods, coupled with the lack of government oversight and controls, illustrate what he calls &ldquo;the silo problem&rdquo; &ndash; each agency focuses
    on &ldquo;a narrow aspect of the problem without any integrated effort to stitch all the pieces together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bellinger&rsquo;s coalition is calling for swift national action. &ldquo;Further delay,&rdquo; it warns, &ldquo;will result in more children experiencing lifelong health problems.&rdquo;</p>
