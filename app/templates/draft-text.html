<p>Her Kensington neighborhood is full of charm. Swank cafes with rustic wood and vintage lighting. Stoops and decks with skyline views. A network of young parents who bond at parks while their children play. </p>
<p>Jana Curtis, a mother of three, finds excitement in this urban renaissance.</p>
<p>But with it comes a sad reality.</p>
<p>Her daughter was poisoned by lead. The culprit wasn&rsquo;t paint. Or tap water. But soil &ndash; in her own back yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yard was poisoning my daughter,&rdquo; Curtis said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just so horrifying.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Curtis and her family live in the heart of what was once Philadelphia&rsquo;s industrial hub. For more than 150 years, the &ldquo;river ward&rdquo; neighborhoods of Fishtown, Kensington and Port Richmond, which snake along the Delaware, were blanketed
    with hulking factories and lead smelters. It was a time when manufacturers used lead in everything from paints to plastics. Lunch-pail laborers walked to work from tightly packed rowhomes as lead dust spewed from smokestacks, coating sidewalks, stoops
    and yards.</p>
<p>Once in the soil, the heavy metal stays indefinitely. Even miniscule amounts can permanently lower a child&rsquo;s IQ and cause behavioral problems.</p>
<p>At one time, Philadelphia had 38 lead smelters &ndash; more than any other city in America. Fourteen alone operated in the river wards.</p>
<p>The lead plants are long gone, either razed or shuttered. But a toxic legacy remains.</p>
<p>Now, amid a development boom, lead that had sat dormant for decades threatens a new generation of children. Every day, construction crews &ndash; unchecked by government &ndash; can churn up poisonous soil, potentially spreading toxic dust across these
    gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In the area&rsquo;s most sweeping environmental investigation to date, reporters tested soil in 114 locations &ndash; parks, playgrounds, backyards. Nearly three out of four had hazardous levels of lead contamination &ndash;a problem of previously unknown
    severity.</p>
<p>Reporters also discovered high levels of lead dust on rowhome stoops and sidewalks near construction sites. In tests taken from a popular neighborhood playground &ndash; both before and after digging began at a vacant lot across the street &ndash; a once-safe
    play area was shown to contain lead dust.</p>
<p>Developers are not required to test soil for lead as a routine precaution before disturbing land. And no single governmental agency is tasked with oversight, leaving residents unprotected while federal, state and city officials quibble over who,
    if anyone, should regulate development within a former industrial area.</p>
<p>State and federal officials say they only oversee development and cleanup with the boundaries of known contaminated sites. City officials say they don&rsquo;t regulate soil. The city&rsquo;s Department of Public Health is supposed to enforce a regulation
    that requires construction crews to contain noxious dust.</p>
<p>But in the past several months, reporters witnessed ongoing construction at least two dozen times. Not once did they see workers take dust-control measures, even something as simple as spraying water to hold down dust. </p>
<p>Philadelphia Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said the city enforces the regulation &ldquo;to the extent that we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farley pointed out that health data shows lead paint &ndash; not soil &ndash; is the primary source of childhood lead poisoning. While parents should try and prevent their children from playing in dirt in these neighborhoods, Farley said, he doesn&rsquo;t
    consider soil a major risk.</p>
<p>Any source of lead is cause for concern, said Mary Jean Brown, an adjunct professor at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child doesn&rsquo;t distinguish where it came from,&rdquo; Brown said.</p>
<p>As chief of lead-poisoning prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2014, Brown spearheaded a study of contaminated soil in the river wards and knows its dangers. The wave of new construction only adds to the peril, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they&rsquo;re digging it up and it&rsquo;s fine enough to be inhaled, then it&rsquo;s a big issue,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ignore this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jenni Drozdek and Dan Morgan knew all about the neighborhood&rsquo;s toxic legacy when they moved into their home on Cumberland Street in Kensington.</p>
<p>They even had their soil tested before planting a garden in 2011. The result came back at 662 parts per million (ppm), considerably higher than the federal threshold. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers hazardous any lead concentration above 400 ppm in soil where children play.</p>
<p>The couple installed raised beds filled with new topsoil so they could plant kale, tomatoes, herbs, beets and carrots. They also spread a thick, protective layer of mulch over the rest of the yard.</p>
<p>When their daughter, Mina, was born three years later, they thought she would be safe.</p>
<p>Then the construction fever hit.</p>
<p>All around them, demolition crews worked at a frenzied pace. The buzz of saws and the rhythmic bleep of excavators backing up could be heard on almost every block. In their 19125 zip code, the number of demolitions doubled between 2015 and 2016. Construction projects that stirred up soil quadrupled over six years.</p>
<p>The mammoth reconstruction of I-95 at the Girard Avenue Interchange also added to the dust bowl.</p>
<p>The grit made residents&rsquo; eyes water. And there were days when Drozdek found her gray Nissan blanketed in dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to clean it off because I couldn&rsquo;t see out the windows,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Last August, the city&rsquo;s Department of Public Health adopted more stringent dust control regulations. But some 30 Fishtown and Kensington residents interviewed in the past few months said they never witnessed a construction project with dust controls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no effort to contain it whatsoever,&rdquo; Drozdek said.</p>
<p>The couple often takes Mina to one of the busiest parks in Fishtown, Shissler Recreation Center on Blair Street. It once was the site of a major railroad hub and train yard.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a reporter took a dust-wipe sample from the playground and found no detectable levels of lead.</p>
<p>About three months later, in early May, a reporter took another sample from the same spot. At the time, construction workers were using heavy equipment to dig into vacant land across the street. Dust and dirt were swirling around as children were busy at play.</p>
<p>This sample shot up to 127.4 micrograms of lead in dust per square foot. While there is no federal hazard level for outdoor surfaces, the limit for entryways and indoor floors is 40. There is no way to know for sure whether the lead came from the construction site across the street.</p>
<p>Exposure to contaminated soil and demolition debris containing lead paint can significantly increase blood lead levels in children, studies show.</p>
<p>A child who inhales lead dust faces more danger than one who swallows a chip of lead paint because the toxic metal has a more direct pathway to the brain, experts say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingestion is bad,&rdquo; said Richard Pepino, an environmental toxicology expert at the University of Pennsylvania. &ldquo;Inhalation is worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple dust-control measures can prevent people from being harmed, but the health department only has four air management inspectors and two supervisors to oversee a city that last year alone had 3,000 demolition and construction jobs.</p>
<p>When Drozdek and Morgan took Mina to her routine one-year checkup, her bloodwork came back with a poisonous level of lead: 9 micrograms per deciliter.</p>
<p>The CDC says public health and pediatricians should intervene when children have blood lead levels of 5. And the agency is poised to lower the actionable level to 3.5.</p>
<p>For now, Philadelphia&rsquo;s health department only investigates when a child hits a level 10. Drozdek&rsquo;s daughter is among some 2,000 city children every year who spike a blood lead level between 5 and 10 and whose families are left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was terrified because you hear how lead poisoning and any kind of lead levels can be dangerous,&rdquo; Drozdek said.</p>
<p>Drozdek bought kits to detect lead on painted surfaces and tested all over her house. That wasn&rsquo;t it. The couple had their water tested. They ruled that out, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was definitely coming from the outside,&rdquo; Morgan concluded. But where exactly?</p>
<p>Drozdek and Morgan invited reporters to retest their yard. At the time, a giant excavator clawed into a large vacant lot on Letterly Street directly behind their house. Digging had gone on for days, creating a hole roughly the size of an Olympic swimming pool.</p>
<p>Around the corner at Amber and Cumberland streets, a work crew heaped dirt and rubble into 8-feet-high piles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are mounds of it and children climb on it and play on it,&rdquo; Drozdek said. &ldquo;Then of course when it&rsquo;s windy, the top layer gets blown all over the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two soil samples from their backyard tested high for lead &ndash; 635 and 726.</p>
<p>Reporters also swipe tested for lead dust on their front steps. It came back at 1,760 micrograms, 44 times higher than the residential limit.</p>
<p>When told the result, Drozdek was speechless. Dread washed over her face, realizing that Mina has spent hours on the stoop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would grab the steps and pivot herself to the next one. Of course, she&rsquo;s a little kid so she&rsquo;s putting hands in her mouth,&rdquo; Drozdek recalled.</p>
<p>Mina&rsquo;s blood lead level is lower now. Every day, the couple gives her iron drops to prevent lead from binding to her bones. They clean religiously, even whipping down stroller wheels.</p>
<p>Still, as the construction boom continues, they wonder if it&rsquo;s enough.</p>

<p>Longtime residents like Gregory Antczak thought they had found something of a solution to their neighborhood&rsquo;s toxic legacy more than a generation ago. Now they know differently.</p>
<p>Antczak grew up in the shadow of the area&rsquo;s most notorious lead factory, an 8-acre complex of buildings and 20 smokestacks sprawled along both sides of Aramingo Avenue. Over the decades, residents knew the behemoth by different names. John
    T. Lewis Brothers. Dutch Boy Paint. National Lead. And finally, Anzon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always did the same thing,&rdquo; said Antczak, 68, of the companies. &ldquo;They processed millions and millions of pounds of lead in the middle of a highly-populated residential neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a boy, he had to take part in routine family evacuations. &ldquo;A siren would go off inside the factory. It was like an air-raid siren, shrill and high,&rdquo; he said. The sound signaled a fire, chemical spill or some other peril.</p>
<p>His dad would utter the same four words: &ldquo;Get in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antczak and his older brother would hop into the family&rsquo;s two-tone 1950 Ford -- white roof, salmon-colored body &ndash; as black smoke and a noxious smell filled the air. His dad drove eight miles north to Antczak&rsquo;s aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the same thing all the time,&rdquo; Antczak said. &ldquo;We get there, the coffee pot would go on the stove, the cake would come out of the refrigerator and then we&rsquo;d wait it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family had a puppy, a black mutt named Eliza Jane. At only a year old, the dog has a distended stomach and couldn&rsquo;t stop vomiting. Their beloved pet died from what the vet called &ldquo;lead belly,&rdquo; Antczak said.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Antczak, who worked as a mailman, got married and bought a house near his family on Almond Street, about a block and a half from the plant. Several years later, a plant fire blasted out so much lead dust that Anzon evacuated the surrounding
    blocks. It took Anzon three days to vacuum streets and sidewalks, and decontaminate homes, inside and out. </p>
<p>By then, Antczak and other residents had had enough. They sued Anzon in 198x for contaminating their homes and imperiling their children. Years later, they settled with the company. Most families received anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to, in
    one case, $16,000. Many families used some of the money to pave over their back yards with concrete to encapsulate the toxic soil.</p>
<p>Anzon began demolishing the plant in the 1999, leaving behind a vast pile of dirt. The EPA said the site was too toxic for new homes. So under a special program designed to develop contaminated land for commercial use, the state Department of Environmental
    Protection (DEP) oversaw a clean-up, completed in 2003.</p>
<p>The former <strong>brownfield</strong> is now an asphalt-covered retail hub with an Applebee&rsquo;s, Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts, Rite Aid, AutoZone and Wawa, thanks to Port Richmond Development, a private company. Rather than carting off the toxic mound, the
    developer was allowed to cap it with a foot or more of clean fill dirt and plant grass. Residents have dubbed the mound &ldquo;Mt. Wawa.&rdquo; Many cringe when they see children playing on it.</p>
<p>As part of an agreement with the DEP, which owns the hill, the developer has to have an environmental company inspect the hill and surrounding asphalt every year. The task involves little more than looking at it.</p>
<p>An inspection log for the site from 2004 to 2012 shows that an inspector wrote the same two sentences for the nine consecutive visits: &ldquo;All asphalt perfect condition. All grass and landscaping perfectly in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state does not require the developer to test for lead in the fill dirt capping the mound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents have had their doubts. Five years ago, some of them urged the EPA to determine whether Mt. Wawa was safe. The developer&rsquo;s environmental firm gave an answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to report, as expected, that the cap is being appropriately maintained, and remains protective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reporters recently tested a patch of bare soil at the apron of Mt. Wawa. Its lead level came back at 2,904 ppm, about six times the allowable limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were told it was safe, that it was all encapsulated,&rdquo; said Sandy Salzman, former executive director of the New Kensington Community Development Corporation. This news brought fresh worry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the summer time, the kids play there and slide down the hill,&rdquo; Saltzman said. &ldquo;<strong>No trespassing&rdquo; signs appeared on the hill after reporters began making inquiries.</strong></p>
<p>RESPONSE FROM DEVELOPER HERE</p>
<p>Just across the street is Cione Playground, which decades ago had been saturated with Anzon&rsquo;s lead. In a one-time arrangement, the city received $500,000 from the company in 199<strong>x</strong> to abate the lead and, under EPA guidance,
    make the playground safe for the public.</p>
<p>Reporters recently tested soil at Cione&rsquo;s ballfields, and it came back low. But soil tested in four locations near the community swimming pool returned unsafe levels, between 613 and 955 ppm.</p>
<p>Told of the test results, city spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said the city was not responsible for regulating soil. &ldquo;If we become aware of a toxic soil situation, we notify EPA and /or DEP,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
